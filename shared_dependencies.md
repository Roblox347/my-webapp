The shared dependencies between the files we are generating are:

1. **Next.js**: This is the main framework used for building the application. It is used in all the files for server-side rendering and routing.

2. **React**: Next.js is built on top of React, so React is also a shared dependency across all the files.

3. **TypeScript**: TypeScript is used for type checking and improved developer experience. It is used in all the `.tsx` files.

4. **CSS Modules**: CSS Modules are used for styling the components. They are used in the `globals.css` and `Home.module.css` files.

5. **Vercel**: Vercel is the platform where the application will be deployed. It is used in the `.vercelignore` file.

6. **Common Components**: The `Header.tsx` and `Footer.tsx` components are likely to be used across multiple pages of the application.

7. **Common Styles**: The `globals.css` file contains global styles that are used across all the pages of the application.

8. **Common Assets**: The `vercel.svg` and `favicon.ico` files in the `public` directory are used across all the pages of the application.

9. **Common Configuration**: The `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, and `next.config.js` files contain configuration that is used across the entire application.

10. **Git**: The `.gitignore` file is used by Git, which is a version control system used across the entire application.

11. **App Component**: The `_app.tsx` file is a custom App component that initializes pages. It can be used to persist layout between page changes.

12. **Document Component**: The `_document.tsx` file is a custom Document component used to augment the application's `<html>` and `<body>` tags.

13. **Index Page**: The `index.tsx` file is the main page of the application. It is likely to use the `Header.tsx` and `Footer.tsx` components, as well as the `Home.module.css` styles.
